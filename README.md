# 🧪 This Profile is my Github Playground

It includes my half-finished ideas, learning projects, and syncing brain wiki notes.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Expect messy code, if it's public at all... you're lucky it's readable!
- These projects are not intended for production or general use, they're strictly intended to show off and work on specific skillsets that *I personally have*.
- If you're cloning my code, uploading it to your own portfolio, and calling it yours, I can't stop you from doing that... just know that doing that is usually more trouble than it's worth. (If you're just experimenting, using specific snippets, this disclaimer isn't for you. Have fun!)

### 🗃️ Projects in Here
