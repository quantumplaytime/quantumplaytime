# 🧪 This Profile is my Github Playground

It includes my half-finished ideas and learning projects. Mostly everything is unfinished and may never be touched again.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Expect messy code, broken components, and barely any documentation.
- These projects are not intended for production or general use.
- If you're here out of curiosity, then welcome. Just don't expect much.

### 🗃️ Projects in Here
