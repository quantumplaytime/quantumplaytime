# 🧪 This Profile is my Github Playground

It includes my half-finished ideas, learning projects, and syncing brain wiki notes.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Expect messy code, if it's public at all... you're lucky it's readable!
- These projects are not intended for production or general use, they're strictly intended to show off and work on specific skillsets that *I personally have*.
- If you're just cloning my code and uploading it to your own portfolio, I can't stop you... just know that doing that doesn't help you in the long run. You will most likely spend more time on trying to understand my code rather than simply being inspired and making your own, if you are serious enough to be making a portfolio for yourself; just do it on your own. This isn't for me and my work, but for the sake of your time, learning, and integrity. (If you are just copying snippets for certain things or as a base for your own changes and skillsets... then this disclaimer isn't directed at you. Have fun.)

### 🗃️ Projects in Here
